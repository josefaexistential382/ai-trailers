# ai-trailers

Capture AI coding tool prompts as git trailers in commit messages.

## Why?

AI coding tools are transforming how we write software. But when you look at a git history, you only see the code that changed — not the human intent that guided it.

Every prompt you write to an AI tool is a decision. It captures *why* you made a change, *what* you asked for, and *how* you directed the AI. Today, that context is lost the moment your session ends.

**ai-trailers** preserves that context by embedding your prompts directly into commit messages as standard git trailers — making your intent searchable, reviewable, and permanent.

The code tells you *what* changed. The trailers tell you *why*.

## How it works

1. **Capture** — Each AI tool's hook system fires when you submit a prompt. ai-trailers captures it and stores it in a local `.ai-trailers` file.
2. **Append** — When you commit, a `commit-msg` git hook appends the captured prompts to your commit message as standard git trailers.
3. **Clear** — The `.ai-trailers` file is cleared after each commit, ready for the next round.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

ai-trailers requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) to be installed. If you don't have it yet:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Install

```bash
bunx ai-trailers init
```

That's it. ai-trailers will auto-detect which AI tools are in your repo and install the necessary hooks.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ai-trailers init` | Auto-detect AI tools and install all hooks |
| `ai-trailers install <tool>` | Install hook for a specific tool |
| `ai-trailers remove [tool]` | Remove all hooks, or just one tool's hook |
| `ai-trailers status` | Show installation status and pending prompts |
| `ai-trailers log [count]` | Show recent commits with AI trailers (default: 20) |
| `ai-trailers --help` | Show help |
| `ai-trailers --version` | Show version |

## Supported tools

| Tool | Hook Event | Config File |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `UserPromptSubmit` | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Kiro | `promptSubmit` | `.kiro/hooks/ai-trailers.kiro.hook` |
| Gemini | `BeforeAgent` | `.gemini/settings.json` |
| Codex | `UserPromptSubmit` | `.codex/hooks.json` |

> **Note:** Kiro passes the user prompt via the `USER_PROMPT` environment variable, which strips newlines from multiline prompts. This is a Kiro limitation — multiline prompts will appear as a single line in the trailers.

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `AI_TRAILERS_TIMESTAMP=1` | off | Include UTC timestamps in trailers |

## Example output

A commit message with ai-trailers looks like this:

```
fix: resolve auth redirect loop

AI-Tool: Claude Code
AI-Prompt: fix the login redirect loop that happens when the session expires
 and the user is on a protected route
```

With timestamps enabled (`AI_TRAILERS_TIMESTAMP=1`):

```
fix: resolve auth redirect loop

AI-Tool: Claude Code
AI-Timestamp: 2026-03-24T21:06:31.016Z
AI-Prompt: fix the login redirect loop that happens when the session expires
 and the user is on a protected route
```

## Adding a new tool

Add an entry to the `tools` array in `src/tools.ts`:

```ts
{
  name: "Your Tool",
  markers: [".your-tool"],
  extractPrompt: () => extractFromStdin({ format: "json", path: "prompt" }),
  hook: {
    hookEvent: "PromptSubmit",
    settingsPath: ".your-tool/settings.json",
    generateConfig: () => ({
      hooks: {
        PromptSubmit: [
          {
            command: `bunx ai-trailers capture --tool "Your Tool"`,
          },
        ],
      },
    }),
  },
}
```

Each tool defines how it extracts the prompt via `extractPrompt`. Available helpers from `src/extractors.ts`:

- `extractFromStdin({ format: "json", path: "prompt" })` — parse stdin JSON and read a field by path
- `extractFromStdin({ format: "text" })` — read stdin as plain text
- `extractFromEnv("VAR_NAME")` — read from an environment variable
